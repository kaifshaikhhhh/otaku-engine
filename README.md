Otaku Engine is a content recommendation system for anime enthusiasts. It leverages machine learning techniques to provide personalized anime recommendations based on user interactions and ratings.

## Project Overview

The Otaku Engine project aims to recommend anime to users based on their past reviews and interactions with different anime titles. The system utilizes the Surprise library, a Python scikit for building and evaluating recommendation systems.

## Dataset

The project uses two main datasets:

- `anime.csv`: Contains information about anime titles, including unique IDs and titles.
- `rating.csv`: Stores user ratings for different anime titles.

## Getting Started

To run the Otaku Engine project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/kaifshaikhhhh/otaku-engine.git
cd otaku-engine
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


3. Download the dataset files (`anime.csv` and `rating.csv`) and place them in the project directory.

4. Open the notebook `otaku_engine.ipynb`


5. Enter the user ID when prompted to receive personalized anime recommendations.

## Results and Evaluation

The project utilizes the Surprise library's SVD algorithm to train the recommendation model. The model is evaluated using cross-validation, measuring the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics.

The performance of the model can be observed in the console output during the cross-validation process.

## Example Output

Below is an example output of the Otaku Engine, recommending anime for a specific user:
